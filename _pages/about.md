I am a 1st-year PhD student in NLP at the [Department of Data Science & AI, Monash University](https://research.monash.edu/en/organisations/department-of-data-science-ai), supervised by [Dr. Ehsan Shareghi](https://eehsan.github.io), [Prof. Nigel Collier](https://sites.google.com/site/nhcollier/home) and [Prof. Wray Buntine](https://bayesian-models.org). My main research interest is graph-based text generation, exploring and improving the generative capability of language models (e.g., graph-to-text generation, text-to-graph generation).

Prior to this, I obtained my Master of Science (Computer Science) degree at [University of Melbourne](https://www.unimelb.edu.au). During my master stage, I finished a NLP research project which was about the variational graph-to-text generation, supervised by [Prof. Trevor Cohn](https://people.eng.unimelb.edu.au/tcohn/) and [Dr. Daniel Beck](https://beckdaniel.wordpress.com).
